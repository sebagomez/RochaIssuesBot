Genexus Issue Tracking Bot
==========================

Genexus Issue tracking bot is a bot developed with the newly released [Microsoft Bot Framework](https://dev.botframework.com/).

It adds integration with Language Undertanding Intelligent Service ([Luis](http://luis.ai)) for understanding natural language queries to the internal Genexus Issue tracking system.

It was first added to [slack](http://slack.com) and probably will be added to Skype and/or Telegram.
